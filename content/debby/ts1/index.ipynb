    "Taylor Swift is an American singer and songwriter who is renowned for her talent and relatable songs. She started as a country singer at the age of 16 and has earned massive success for over a decade. Different from other stereotype artists, she made most of her music and told stories in her songs. She always goes in depth and you know exactly how she was feeling. Her songs aren’t about clubs, alcohol, sex or drugs, they’re about real and honest life. That’s why she is adored by fans all over the world and becomes an inspiration for many young people. Lots of teenagers enjoy her music, they repeat her tracks while waiting for the bus, strolling in the park or with their feet up in the bedrooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I choose her lyrics to do analysis since I understand it’s not easy to write down your feelings and put them into your works. Everyone has feelings that are worthy to capture and remember. You do something a thousand times and remember the one time it was different. That’s the fantastic part of life and that’s your own story and you never get bored with yourself. When I was in the literature class (I didn’t skip class that day and shout out to FLLD), my professor said that the hardest part is to conceptualize personal thoughts and feelings rather than to produce great hits. This can also apply to music industry. Taylor stuck to her country root and described what she had thought about (at least before 1989 was coming out). I like this topic and I’ll try to find out various themes of Taylor’s songs and analyze the data. Let’s start with data collection…"

    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "__PyLyrics__ is a python module to get lyrics of songs from lyrics.wikia.com. It can get lyrics based on a specfic album. I don't need songs from all of her albums because one is holiday album (Christmas songs, not written by her) and three contain songs that overlap with other albums. Therefore, my target albums are _Taylor Swift_, _Fearless_, _Speak Now_, _Red_, _1989_, _Reputation_. "

songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?\\n\\nTim McGraw:\\nI have heard this song.\\n\\nDJ:\\nTim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?\\n\\nTim:\\nIt was awesome. Uh, except for I didn\\'t know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.\\n\\nDJ:\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTim:\\nI didn\\'t know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more... I don\\'t know if it\\'s true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I\\'m old. I don\\'t know if that\\'s true but that\\'s what I choose to think.\\n\\nDJ:\\nWhy don\\'t we find out? Taylor is a compliment or uh he\\'s old?\\n\\nTaylor:\\nOh it\\'s definitely a compliment. Yeah.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nDJ:\\nTim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.\\n\\nTim:\\nNice-\\n\\nTaylor:\\nNice to meet you.\\n\\nTim:\\nNice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?\\n\\nTaylor:\\nI\\'m doing great. How are you doing?\\n\\nTim:\\nI\\'m doing good. Congratulations on your record! It\\'s doing great.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nThank you so much. I\\'m just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I\\'m not a stalker. \\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nDJ:\\nWell-\\n\\nTaylor:\\nThe funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer, some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you\\'ll do them writing a song and it\\'ll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn\\'t think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we\\'re putting that out.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTim:\\nWell I\\'m glad ya did \\'cause um it\\'s doing well for ya.\\n\\nDJ:\\nSo I-\\nSo I understand that you two guys have not talked?\\n\\nTim:\\nNo.\\n\\nDJ:\\nYou haven\\'t met?\\n\\nTim:\\nNo.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nNo, we\\'ve never talked or met or anything.\\n\\nTim:\\nI sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don\\'t remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don\\'t know if she got it or not.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nOh my God. They never gave that to me.\\n\\nTim:\\nThey didn\\'t? Okay well, there ya go. I did.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nDJ:\\nSo I-I\\n\\nTaylor:\\nWe\\'ve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.\\n\\nTim:\\nNot at all.\\n\\nDJ:\\nSo I thought, I think it\\'s pretty brave to put out a song called \"Tim McGraw\" without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?\\n\\nTaylor:\\nIt was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I didn\\'t say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn\\'t take it too bad.\\n\\nTim:\\nWell, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I\\'m sure there\\'s plenty that could\\'ve been said. Tell me-\\n\\nTaylor:\\nCould you tell Faith that I said hello?\\n\\nTim:\\nI sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nOh my gosh, she\\'s awesome.\\n\\nTim:\\nI agree.\\n\\nDJ:\\nThis, this... tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?\\n\\nTaylor:\\nWell, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I\\'m gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTaylor:\\nI actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.\\n\\nTim:\\nNow I feel old.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nAnd um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.\\n\\nTim:\\nAww, thank you.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nAnd uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out all right. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes \"well that\\'s your first single\"\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTaylor:\\n\"And I\\'m like \"well...\"\\n\\nTim:\\nWell you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTaylor:\\nThat\\'s awesome. There\\'s a part two coming out next month.\\n\\nTim:\\nAll right, great.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTim:\\nWell congratulations \\'cause it\\'s your first single, first top ten hit and that\\'s pretty exciting and I know you\\'re off to the races here. You\\'re just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nAwesome, it\\'s been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?\\n\\nTim:\\nUm I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. We\\'ll have to look into that.\\n\\n*Laughs*\\n\\nTaylor:\\nWell I\\'ll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.\\n\\nTim:\\nYa do? What would-\\n\\nTaylor:\\nYeah.\\n\\nTim:\\nWhat would their name be?\\n\\nTaylor:\\nUh, um I think Taylor something.\\n\\nTim:\\nSomething like that yeah.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nBut-\\n\\nTim:\\nWell I\\'ll, I\\'ll be more than happy to have you out with me.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nJust consider it.\\n\\nDJ:\\nAh, well that\\'s very good. You\\'re pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I\\'ll tell ya that.\\n\\nTim:\\nRight she\\'s, she\\'s gonna be forward this time.\\n\\nDJ:\\nI think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.\\n\\nTim:\\nAbsolutely.\\n\\nDJ:\\nHey Taylor, I know you\\'re on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.\\n\\nTaylor:\\nIt was awesome and thank you.
