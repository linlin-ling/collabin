    "After gathering subtitles from the OpenSubtitles parallel corpora, I've set my sights on the translations that are available for most TED talks. According to the [official website](https://ted.com), TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to spreading ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transcriptions are ideal for a parallel corpus because the translation process is supervised and quality is ensured through the use of a style guide and reviewers who are experienced and check on the quality of a translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of crawling directly from the official website, I will use the [TCSE: Ted Corpus Search Engine](https://yohasebe.com/tcse/) because the transcriptions are already organized with helpful metadata, such as timestamps. Furthermore, the website provides a helpful option to combine subtitles into sentences, which is based on the English timestamps. If lines in an English transcription are combined, then the corresponding timestamps in another language will be used to combine transcriptions. I think.\n",
